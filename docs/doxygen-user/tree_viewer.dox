/*! \page tree_viewer_page Tree Viewer

The Tree Viewer shows the discovered folders by the data sources they come from, as well as a list of files in the folders. It is located on the left side of the Autopsy screen. The "Group by Data Source" option on the top left moves all views, results, and tags under their corresponding data source.

Each folder in the tree on the left shows how many items are contained within it in parentheses after the directory name. See the picture below.
